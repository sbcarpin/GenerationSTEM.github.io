											<p> Classes are introduced to the program by explaining it or playing the 2 minute introduction animation in the <a class="link-1" href="StudentsPage.html">students page</a>. Then classes work in pairs to do the engineering design activies. Finally, classes are split into groups of four to five students, with each group using a device equipped with the Cue robot application and a Wonder Workshop Cue Robot. Each robot is assigned a persona, obstacle course, and mission that can be found <a class="link-1" href="index-2.html">here</a>. The ultimate goal of the activity is for groups to code their robot’s path through their obstacle course, effectively achieving their narrative’s mission.

Groups are given a coding instruction card which guides them in writing code to animate their robot. Groups will return to their respective robot and obstacle course to input code on the Cue app. Groups will recieve narractive cards for the beginning and ending of the robots. The materials for each robot is found in the materials page. Encouragement of the engineering design process is told throughout the whole session.</p>

Pairs are required to spend the first two minutes working together to plan out their design idea on the engineering paper before they were allowed to begin building. Students are updated on remaining time with 5 minutes, 3 minutes, and 1 minute left. At the end of the 10 minutes, the towers are measured with a yard sticks to determine the winner.

Pairs are required to spend the first two minutes working together to plan out their design idea on the engineering paper before they were allowed to begin building. Students are updated on remaining time with 5 minutes, 3 minutes, and 1 minute left. At the end of the 10 minutes, the towers are tested for strength with 1lb sandbags.

												<li>To ensure that all materials are properly configured, it is important to accommodate for one hour of preparatory work prior to student participation.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><strong>Assemble a team of at least seven members</strong></li>
											<li><ul class="listInner">
												<li>Student participation is maximized if every student group is assisted by a supervising facilitator. It is recommended that at least seven team members are present for any implementation of this program. </li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><strong>At least one Spanish speaking team member</strong></li>
											<li><ul class="listInner">
												<li>To ensure all students are actively engaged in the material, it is highly recommended that one supervising facilitator on the team be a fluent Spanish speaker. Many students participating in the program learned Spanish as their first language and are currently learning English. Providing students with a resource such as this will significantly improve the effectiveness of the program.</li>
												</ul>
											<li>
											<li><strong>Plan for a two hour lesson</strong></li>
											<li><strong>Have an agenda</strong></li>
											<li><ul class="listInner">
												<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Provide an in-depth description of the program’s goals and flow</li>
												<li><strong>Engineering Design Activities</strong>: Run the acitivty but keep track of time</li>
												<li><strong>Tutorial</strong>: Provide a visual tutorial of the Cue robot application. Use a coding instruction card to walk students through implementing code. </li>
												<li><strong>Split into groups</strong>: Student groups should have 4 members; 5 maximum. Assign supervising facilitator to each group </li>
												<li><strong>Program participation</strong>: Use a timer to facilitate program flow. An hour for engineering design activites. An hour for coding portion.
