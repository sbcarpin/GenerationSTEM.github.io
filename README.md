A website to digitize the content of the education program called GenerationSTEM. For easier access to teachers and students. The program GenerationSTEM's goal is to help underrepresented and more diverse communities to have equal opportunity to STEM education. This website it meant to display the current teaching program (the handbook) on the web. It's meant for future purpose of when teachers would like to run the program on their own, they will have this website to reference the content. The website offers material and resources to the students and teachers. Such as pdf forms to print and animations for the students. The animations were built of Unity and used WebGL to include it into the web.
